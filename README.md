## Tether
**Author**: Joshua Gerrity

Tether is a simple text editor which is meant to combine all of my own text-processing projects into one program. Essentially, this is a front-end for [The Textual Toolbox](https://github.com/DynAggelos/The-Textual-Toolbox). Tether is written in C++, using the wxWidgets library. At the time of this writing, Tether is a school project.
